<p>									Well this is the big one. We've been waiting for this one since E3. Xbox fanboys and Sony fanboys have been constantly at war over it. This is going to be to the Xbox One what Halo was to the Xbox and will finally dethrone Call of Duty as the number 1 FPS.<br /><br />It's time for Titanfall<br /><br />The Game<br /><br />All games in Titanfall are 6v6 with 12 AI characters on each team playing as well. You each play as a pilot, a highly trained soldier which can pilot Titans, and you go round killing other pilots. Titans are called in after they're built (which is about 2 and a half minutes but killing AI and other pilots somehow decreases that time as if you are sacrificing them to the god of Titans) and can either be piloted or you can leave them and they'll run on auto-pilot. You can sort of think of them like killstreaks, but they are so much more.<br /><br />Unfortunately I'm going to have to list off some bad stuff. It's incredibly lacking in game modes (there's only 5). Attrition and pilot hunter are pretty much the same thing aka Team Death match. The main difference is that in Attrition you gain points for killing AI characters as well as pilots whereas pilot hunter is only from killing pilots. Hardpoint is your domination, you try and take over the 3 bases and hold onto them for as long as possible. Capture the flag speaks for itself and last titan standing gives you one life and starts you off in your titan with the goal of destroying all opposing team titans first.<br /><br />The first thing you probably notice about these is that they aren't original whatsoever. They're pretty much the basic modes of any good FPS. You also have campaign missions which are just the same multiplayer game modes, on the same multiplayer maps but you have a really long wait to play them because they have a long speech at the beginning of each which tries to add a story to each game. I have no idea what the story was about because it wasn't very interesting however if you want the other 2 types of titan then you have to finish them all.<br /><br />I don't care about the lack of a campaign too much (it would be nice to have one but I'm not going to cry over it) however if they had done something different for the campaign missions rather than the vanilla game types then I would have enjoyed them a lot more.<br /><br />Other big problems include no private lobbies (Respawn said they'll come out in a free update), lack of map selection so you have to do the map that has been randomly selected and no local play whatsoever.<br /><br />Loadout customisation is good though. You have a lot of choices to make: primary weapon, secondary, Anti-titan weapon, ordanance (grenades basically), an ability and then 2 perks. Once you sorted out your pilot you then get to customise you titan as well which has just as many options. I would have liked to see some aesthetic customising though but that's a minor complaint.<br /><br />If you've reached this far then you probably feel like Titanfall has fallen short of the hype and is a huge disappointment. Well I won't lie, it does feel like it's come out with only the basic requirements for an online shooter, but that's because they've spent all their time creating one of the best shooter experiences I've played in a long time!<br /><br />The Gameplay<br /><br />You start off on a dropship and jump into the match (literally) when the countdown is over and you just get stuck in. No other game has made me feel more like a badass than titanfall. Wallrunning then jumping to another wall to then double jump through a window and catch an unsuspecting player off guard is particularly satisfying. It's because of this gameplay that you won't find many campers because everyones running around to much for camping to work and most hiding spots have multiple entrances so it's in your interest to keep moving.<br /><br />Facing off against titans is great as well. Feeling like David and Goliath you can pull out you anti-titan weapon and start bringing it down or (my personal favourite way of dispatching them) jumping onto their backs and shooting their cores out. That doesn't mean to say the titans can't defend themselves. They have plenty of tricks to remove pilots and their guns can take you out in one hit and yet it's still incredibly balanced.<br /><br />Balancing is probably what this game does best. All the guns feel overpowered but this creates a sense of balance because they're all as overpowered as each other. The standard carbine is great at long, mid and short range but a sniper could take you out faster at long range and a shotgun would easily out class you at short range. The smart pistol can target multiple targets at once and will shoot and instant kill all locked on targets. However other pilots take multiple lock ons so it's not as useful against them. I mainly use shotgun and so I use wallrunning and double jumps to stay out of sight of other players and then drop down on them for a 1 shot kill usually. However if I'm ever spotted by someone with a carbine I don't usually come out so well.<br /><br />If you're getting creamed against better pilots then have no fear as you can still run around and take out the opposing teams AI units. This still net's you points in Attrition and also reduces your titans build time. When you hear over your com "Your titan is ready for launch" you can't help but feel like a kid in a candy shop. With a simple button press you can have your titan fall from the heavens and straight in front of you (or for more fun try and drop it on someones head for an easy kill). At this point you have several choices. You either jump in and play as the titan yourself, set the titan to AI mode and have it follow you or leave it to guard an area. This is great because if you love playing as a pilot you can just set it to follow you and it will earn kills for you (much like a killstreak) or if you prefer playing as a huge mass of metal and bullets then you can jump in and have a different way of playing. Guarding is very useful for games like hardpoint and capture the flag as it allows you to capture a point and protect it without having to sit their and wait. Once you're titans dead though you can quickly eject to carry on playing as a pilot without dying and wait for another one to be built.<br /><br />The maps are perfect for this type of gameplay as there are big open spaces for titans to roam around in, buildings for pilots to roam around in, windows which allow for multiple points of entry for pilots and lots of debris and walls for pilots to wall run on and jump on.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />All of the nay sayers will tell you that Titanfall has done nothing original. It has COD controls, there's loads of mech games, parkour was better in mirrors edge, etc... and for the most part they're right. But titanfall has taken the best attributes from all of those games and added them into 1 game and it creates a completely new experience. Gameplay wise it is superb and it will feel strange going back to games like battlefield and not double jumping around.<br /><br />They still need some more game modes though and if they make a sequel then I'd like to see a bit more effort put into the campaign missions, even if its playing a game of attrition but you can only use a certain weapon or escorting an injured titan through the map. Hopefully some of this can be helped through DLC (Respawn has said there will be free and paid DLC for the game).                                    </p>
