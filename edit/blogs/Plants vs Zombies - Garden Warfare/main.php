<p>					<br />A fun way to pass the time<br />In a world full of first person shooters and third person shooters trying to be as realistic as possible it's refreshing to play one that isn't. Within minutes of playing you will have a big grin on your face as you see engineers jiggling around on their jackhammers and hear sunflowers sigh happily as they reload after unleashing a full clip of sunshine into the face of a zombie. But is it as fun to play as it is to watch?<br />The Game<br />There are 2 main modes, garden ops and multiplayer. The former is your typical wave survival game. As a huge fan of horde mode in Gears of war I decided to start there. You always play as the plants in this mode and you get partnered up with 3 other players online to try to survive waves of zombies. It's worth noting at this point that this is also the only game mode that has 2 player local play but you can't play online with your local friend.<br />Before you start playing you have to pick your plant. The four plants are the peashooter, cactus, sunflower and chomper. Each one plays a different role. Peashooters are your soldier class, chompers are a melee class, cactus is long range and sunflowers are the healers. On top of that every plant has multiple types, which can change how the character plays (the peashooter, for example, can shoot ice instead which can freeze enemies) but must be unlocked, and accessories which are purely aethetic.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very enjoyable. You choose a garden at the beginning which will act as your base and the zombies aim to destroy it. You'll find lots of plant pots scattered around your base as well which you can use to plant plants into which help you defend your base (these aren't unlimited though and you have to keep buying more through in game currency). The waves get more diffiult at a nice pace and every 3 waves there's a boss round which chooses 3 random bosses (or perks like extra cash sometimes). My first go my team and I were a good mix, I was the sunflower and we had 2 peashooters and a cactus and together we finished 2 boss waves and.. got to the final round? Sadly yes, this mode has an ending which comes all to quickly, especially playing on normal difficulty. The ending involves Craazy Dave coming back in his flying car to rescue the plants so you have to run to the escape zone and survive until he arrives. For those who like closure it's great however people like me who prefer to play until you can't go on anymore, and then try to beat that, it's a bit disappointing but doesn't ruin the experience too much as there are higher difficulties.<br />Multiplayer mode is where you get to fight against each other. One team are the plants and the other are the zombies. You don't get to pick which side you're on though but you alternate after every game. Multiplayer has a couple of modes, Team vanquish (aka Team Deathmatch) and Gardens and Graveyards.<br />Team Vanquish involves you having to kill 50 of the other team. Reviving is in the game though so if you manage to revive a teammate your opponents lose a point. There's not much more to say other than it's a pretty standard Team Deathmatch gametype. Gardens and Graveyards however, plays more like Battlefield's Rush mode. The plants defend a garden while the Zombies attempt to convert it to a graveyard. There are usually around 10 gardens to defend but you don't have to defend all/ convert all to win as the game rewards on how many you did defend/convert but will give you an extra bonus if you do.<br />Gameplay<br />Every character feels different to play as. They each have three abilities which are unique to the character. For example, the Chomper makes you try and hide round corners so you can burrow underground and go in for the instant kill whereas the Zombie Soldier has a jetpack which gives it a super jump allowing it to shoot at enemies from the higher ground. Strangely though it all seems to balance out. I never felt like either team had an advantage over the other, which is impressive considering how different each team is. I was a little upset with how slow it is though. Only the peashooter and Engineer have a way of sprinting (Peashooters have hyper mode and engineers ride on their jackhammers) so when you die and go back to the spawn point it can take a while to get back to the action.<br />Levelling up can be particularly annoying sometimes. To level up you must complete challenges which start off fairly easy, mostly using the new ability you just unlocked. This is great until you start reaching higher levels, I was stuck on level 4 for my engineer for ages because one of the challenges was to use a sonic grenade on 3 Chompers which are burrowed underground. The reason this was annoying was because some games nobody played as a chomper and when they did they wouldn't necessarily use their burrow ability. While I appreciated how the challenges made me play differently in the lower levels they were just too specific in the higher levels meaning a lot of game time was wasted not gaining any levels.<br />Unlocking new characters and plants to use in Garden Ops is done by buying sticker packs. After every game you are rewarded with coins which are used to buy the sticker packs so you can currently unlock everything just by playing the game. The more expensive the sticker packs the better the items inside, which is worth it because the stickers are random everytime.<br />Overall<br />PvZ: Garden Warfare is a funny game which doesn't take itself too seriously. It is surprisingly well made to with some great mechanics within it. However with a lack of game modes there isn't much to do here and sometimes levelling can feel like a grind because of specific challenges. That being said I do enjoy playing it and would recommend people to play this if they didn't have anything else to play. This is a great start in expanding the PvZ franchise and I would look forward to playing a sequel to this if they decided to make one as it has a lot of potential.        </p>
