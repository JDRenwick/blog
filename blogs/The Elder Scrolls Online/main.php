	<div id="main"><h2>It looks like an Elder Scrolls game, feels like one but it is so much more</h2>  <p>Around five hours into my time with the most recent beta of The Elder Scrolls Online, I found myself compelled to do something I almost never attempt in an MMORPG: I plugged my Xbox 360 controller into the USB port and hoped it would work. Alas, it didn't. And so I fiddled with programs like Xpadder and others until cobbled together a setup that proved my suspicions were correct. With the right tweaks and button binds, ESO plays as well as any Elder Scrolls game for consoles.</p>  <p>That gives me hope for players who'll experience ESO not on the PC, but on the Xbox One and PS4. It's hard to state just how novel this is for an MMO; even Final Fantasy XIV, with its uncommonly adept gamepad support, still felt as though it was struggling to cram abilities designed for multiple keyboard rows into the limited binds of a console controller.</p>  <p>Elder Scrolls Online suffers from no such limitations. Of the wide range of abilities you can learn from weapons, armor types, and even NPC guilds, you can only slot five of them to your bar at any time (plus one ultimate and a consumable), and that number only doubles once you get to swap weapons in combat at level 15.</p>  <p>It's here where Elder Scrolls Online captures the Elder Scrolls experience best. I confess I never quite warmed to playing Skyrim on a keyboard; even on PC, my best experiences involved pulling back the gamepad trigger as though I were physically pulling the string on my bow, and that feeling translates well here in both first- and third-person perspectives. I'd tap on the left thumbstick and crouch into stealth, and I'd hold down yet another button that'd unleashed my two-handed hammer's power moves onto scamps and atronachs with satisfying thuds. This was the Elder Scrolls Online I wanted to play, and I've never felt more excited about it until I whipped out that controller.</p>  <p>Part of the reason why my most recent romp through Elder Scrolls Online felt so similar to my single-player experience is because I had to play on the sparsely populated Public Test Server, which doesn't capture the experience of playing with other people as well as I wanted. Until I qualified for a dungeon around level 12 (which takes ages in reach in ESO), I might as well been playing Elder Scrolls VI. Importantly, I played no PvP, so I had no idea of how the gamepad would serve me in such a frantic environment.</p>  <p>As an Elder Scrolls fan, this makes me reluctantly happy. You have very little reason to group with players for most of the leveling journey, from what I can tell, and even when you try, there's a good chance your friends will be "phased" (and thus invisible) because they're on a different leg of the quest. It proves that Elder Scrolls Online performs quite well as the single-player RPG experience consoles players are used to, and it's easy to see that ESO's menus and inventory screens were designed for easy translations to consoles. (Don't worry: the native inventory here is far more manageable than Skyrim ever dreamed of.)</p>  <p>This satisfaction carries over to the quests themselves. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I remember a few of them more fondly than some adventures in Skyrim and Oblivion. That's the real reason why I'd personally pick up The Elder Scrolls Online as a fan of the series; it captures the ambiance and lore in ways I'd previously thought impossible, and that means so much more to me than the absence of the ability to kill friendly NPCs or steal random crap off of tavern tables. To conjure the tired comparison, this is far more Skyrim than World of Warcraft.</p>  <p>And yet I can't shake the feeling that this is one of ESO's failings. Star Wars: The Old Republic placed heavy emphasis on its single-player experience to its own detriment, but its wholesale imitation of a successful MMORPG gameplay template at least suggested that it wanted players to work together. Elder Scrolls Online has some wonderful group content -- more on that in another article -- but it seems as though you can avoid it entirely if you wish.</p>  <p>That works for players who just want a new Elder Scrolls game, such as those who played it alone on the Xbox 360 and (sadly, less effectively) on the PS3. But it spells potential disaster for ZeniMax itself if the story ends once you become emperor. For those of us who come to Elder Scrolls for the lore and the world, there may be few reasons to stick around once we've drained all the content; and the appeal of witnessing the other storylines will eventually wear thin as well. Match those concerns with the usual awkwardness of communication on console RPGs and MMORPGs, and the idea of a subscription looks even less appealing.</p>  <p>I could be wrong. If my experiments with the gamepad yield any insight into what ZeniMax has planned for the console version, it's likely that it may have the best foundation for a console MMORPG to date. It works so well because it stays true to the series' roots rather than drawing too heavily from popular MMOs, and it smartly escapes the trap of having too many abilities to use with a gamepad. In that regard, Elder Scrolls Online already seems to succeed triumphantly. Now it just needs to provide us with reasons to stick around and work with others.</p></div>
